# Available Tools Reminder

Remember you have access to:
- **`@firecrawl`:** MCP to fetch and process content from URLs if needed for context.
- **`@context7`:** MCP for retrieving relevant code examples from library documentation.
- **`@llms`:** To search the documentation files stored locally within the `llms/` directory of this project.

Utilize these tools when necessary to gather context or find specific implementation details from documentation.
