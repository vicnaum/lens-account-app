# Project: Lens Account Web Interface (MVP)

**Goal:** Build a web interface for users (Owners) to interact with their Lens Account (a custom EVM Smart Account) on the **Lens Chain (ID 232)**.

**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Account Discovery:** Find Lens Account via username or address.
2.  **Owner Login:** Connect the controlling Owner EOA wallet and verify ownership.
3.  **Basic Dashboard:** Display Lens Account address and WGHO balance.
4.  **WalletConnect v2 (Act as Wallet):** Allow the interface to connect *to* external dApps *on behalf of* the Lens Account using WalletConnect v2.
5.  **Transaction Handling:** Relay transaction requests from connected dApps to the Owner EOA for approval via the Lens Account's `executeTransaction` method.

**Key Concepts:**
-   **Lens Account:** The smart contract wallet being managed.
-   **Owner EOA:** The external wallet (e.g., MetaMask) that controls the Lens Account. Signs `executeTransaction`.
-   **Lens Chain:** ID 232. All interactions target this chain.
-   **WalletConnect (As Wallet):** This app *acts as the wallet* for the Lens Account when connecting to dApps. Uses `@reown/walletkit` or `@walletconnect/web3wallet`.
-   **Wallet Connection (Owner):** Standard EOA connection to *this* app using ConnectKit/Wagmi.
