# Project Specifications

**ALWAYS** refer to the following documents in the project root for detailed requirements, user flows, and technical implementation details:

1.  **`Spec.functional.md`**: Defines user-facing features and scenarios.
2.  **`Spec.technical.md`**: Outlines architecture, components, state management, and implementation specifics.
3.  **`DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`**: Describes the phased development stages and verification steps. Fill in the checkboxes after user confirms the task works.

Base your implementation plan and code generation on the details within these files. If a requirement is unclear or conflicts, ask for clarification referencing the specific document.
