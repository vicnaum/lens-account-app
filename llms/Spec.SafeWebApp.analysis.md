Analysis of Safe Wallet Web App (SWWA) WalletConnect Implementation:

Based on the Src.safe-wallet-web-app.xml file, here's how SWWA handles acting as a WalletConnect wallet proxy for a Safe:

Centralized Service (WalletConnectWallet.ts): They have a dedicated class (WalletConnectWallet) that encapsulates the core WalletConnect SDK logic (@walletconnect/web3wallet or a similar core library). This class handles:

Initialization of the WalletConnect Core and Wallet client once.

Pairing with dApps using URIs.

Managing active sessions.

Listening for WalletConnect events like session_proposal and session_request.

Sending responses back to the dApp (approveSession, rejectSession, respondSessionRequest).

Emitting custom internal events (like SESSION_ADD_EVENT, SESSION_REJECT_EVENT) likely because the underlying SDK might not provide all desired event hooks directly or for internal state management.

React Context Provider (WalletConnectProvider/index.tsx):

This provider initializes the WalletConnectWallet service instance once when the provider mounts.

It holds the state related to WalletConnect (the service instance, active sessions, pending proposals, errors, loading states).

It subscribes to events emitted by the WalletConnectWallet service and updates its own state accordingly, making this state available to consumer components via the WalletConnectContext.

It handles the logic for updating sessions when the Safe's chainId or safeAddress changes.

Crucially, it's placed high enough in the component tree to ensure a single instance exists for the relevant parts of the application.

UI Components (WcHeaderWidget, WcSessionManager, WcConnectionForm, WcProposalForm):

These components consume the WalletConnectContext.

They display UI based on the context's state (e.g., show connection form, show proposal form, show active sessions).

They trigger actions (like pairing, approving/rejecting proposals, disconnecting) by calling methods provided by the context (which in turn call the WalletConnectWallet service).

Request Handling (SafeWalletProvider/index.tsx):

This is a separate, crucial piece. When the WalletConnectWallet service receives a session_request (like eth_sendTransaction or personal_sign), it doesn't execute it directly.

Instead, it seems to use a SafeWalletProvider (likely another context or service wrapping the Safe Core SDK). This provider acts as an EIP-1193 compatible interface for the Safe itself.

The WalletConnectProvider forwards the incoming request (event.params.request) to this SafeWalletProvider.

The SafeWalletProvider interprets the request:

For eth_sendTransaction, it likely creates a Safe Transaction using the Safe Core SDK.

For personal_sign or eth_signTypedData, it likely prepares the appropriate message signing request for the Safe.

It then triggers the necessary UI flow (like opening a transaction confirmation modal via TxModalContext) which will eventually require the actual connected owner wallet to sign/approve the Safe transaction or message.

Once the Safe action is confirmed/executed (or rejected) by the owner EOA, the SafeWalletProvider returns the result (or error) back up the chain, allowing the WalletConnectProvider to send the final response to the dApp via WalletConnect.
